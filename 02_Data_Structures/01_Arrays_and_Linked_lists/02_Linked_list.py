Exercise 2 - Traversing the list

We successfully created a simple linked list. But printing all the values like we did above was pretty tedious. 
What if we had a list with 1,000 nodes?
Let's see how we might traverse the list and print all the values, no matter how long it might be.

The function should take a Python list of values as input and return the head of a linked list that has those values
