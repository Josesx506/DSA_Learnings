Palindrome
A palindrome is a word that is the reverse of itself—that is, it is the same word when read forwards and backwards.

For example:
"madam" is a palindrome
"abba" is a palindrome
"cat" is not
"a" is a trivial case of a palindrome

The goal of this exercise is to use recursion to write a function is_palindrome that takes a string as input and checks
whether that string is a palindrome. (Note that this problem can also be solved with a non-recursive solution, but that's 
not the point of this exercise.)

def is_palindrome(input):
    """
    Return True if input is palindrome, False otherwise.
    
    Args:
       input(str): input to be checked if it is palindrome
    """
    
    # TODO: Write your recursive palindrome checker here
    # Termination / Base condition - If there's only 1 or 0 letters left, it's a palindrome
    if len(input) <= 1:
        return True
    else:
        # Check if the first and last items are equal
        first_char = input[0]
        last_char = input[-1]

        # sub_input is input with first and last char removed
        sub_input = input[1:-1]

        # recursive call, if first and last char are identical, else return False
        return (first_char == last_char) and is_palindrome(sub_input)


# Test Cases
print ("Pass" if  (is_palindrome("")) else "Fail")
print ("Pass" if  (is_palindrome("a")) else "Fail")
print ("Pass" if  (is_palindrome("madam")) else "Fail")
print ("Pass" if  (is_palindrome("abba")) else "Fail")
print ("Pass" if not (is_palindrome("Udacity")) else "Fail")
