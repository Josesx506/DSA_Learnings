Problem Statement
Suppose there is a staircase that you can climb in either 1 step, 2 steps, or 3 steps. In how many possible 
ways can you climb the staircase if the staircase has n steps? Write a recursive function to solve the problem.

Example:

n == 1 then answer = 1

n == 3 then answer = 4
The output is 4 because there are four ways we can climb the staircase:

1 step + 1 step + 1 step
1 step + 2 steps
2 steps + 1 step
3 steps
n == 5 then answer = 13
