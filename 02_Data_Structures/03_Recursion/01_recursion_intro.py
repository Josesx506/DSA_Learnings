Recursion is a technique for solving problems where the solution to a particular problem 
depends on the solution to a smaller instance of the same problem.
'''

# Let's look at the recursive function power_of_2, which calculates  2^ùëõ
def power_of_2(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return 2 * power_of_2(n - 1)

print(power_of_2(5))

'''
Practice Problem
Implement sum_integers(n) to calculate the sum of all integers from  1 to n using recursion. 
    For example, sum_integers(3) should return  6 i.e (3+2+1).
'''
def sum_integers(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return n + sum_integers(n-1)

Gotchas
When using recursion, there are a few things to look out for that you don't have to worry about when 
running a loop (iteratively). Let's go over a few of those items.

Call Stack
We went over an example of the call stack when calling power_of_2(5) above. In this section, we'll 
cover the limitations of recursion on a call stack. Run the cell below to create a really large stack. 
It should raise the error `RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded in comparison`.

Python has a limit on the depth of recursion to prevent a stack overflow. However, some compilers will 
turn tail-recursive functions into an iterative loop to prevent recursion from using up the stack. 
Since Python's compiler doesn't do this, you'll have to watch out for this limit.
'''
# print(power_of_2(10000)) # this will throw a recursion error if uncommented

'''
Slicing
Let's look at recursion on arrays and how you can run into the problem of slicing the array. If you haven't 
heard the term slicing, it's the operation of taking a subset of some data. For example, the list a can be 
sliced using the following operation: a[start:stop]. This will return a new list from index start (inclusive) 
to index stop (exclusive).

Let's look at an example of a recursive function that takes the sum of all numbers in an array. For example, 
the array of [5, 2, 9, 11] would sum to 27 (5 + 2 + 9 + 11).
'''
def sum_array(array):
    # Base Case
    if len(array) == 1:
        return array[0]
    return array[0] + sum_array(array[1:])

arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(f"Recursion list slicing result is {sum_array(arr)}")

'''
Looking at this, you might think it has a running time of O(n), but that isn't correct due to the slice 
operation array[1:]. This operation will take O(k) time to run where k is the number of elements to copy. 
So, this function is actually O(k * n) running time complexity and O(k * n) space complexity.

To visualize this, let's plot the time it takes to slice.
'''
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import statistics
import time
# %matplotlib inline

n_steps = 10
step_size = 1000000
array_sizes = list(range(step_size, n_steps*step_size, step_size))
big_array = list(range(n_steps*step_size))
times = []

# Calculate the time it takes for the slice function to run with different sizes of k
for array_size in array_sizes:
    start_time = time.time()
    big_array[:array_size]
    times.append(time.time() - start_time)

# Graph the results
plt.scatter(x=array_sizes, y=times)
plt.ylim(top=max(times), bottom=min(times))
plt.xlabel('Array Size')
plt.ylabel('Time (seconds)')
plt.plot()

'''
As you can see, it's linear time to slice.

Instead of slicing, we can pass the index for the element that we want to use for addition. 
That will give us the following function:
'''
def sum_array_index(array, index):
    # Base Cases
    if len(array) - 1 == index:
        return array[index] 
    return array[index] + sum_array_index(array, index + 1)

arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(f"Recursion list index result is {sum_array_index(arr, 0)}")

'''
That eliminates the need to do slicing. With the two different functions implemented, let's compare 
the running times.
'''
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import statistics
import time

n_steps = 10
step_size = 50
array_sizes = list(range(step_size, n_steps*step_size, step_size))
big_array = list(range(n_steps*step_size))
sum_array_times = []
sum_array_index_times = []

for array_size in array_sizes:
    subset_array = big_array[:array_size]
    
    start_time = time.time()
    sum_array(subset_array)
    sum_array_times.append(time.time() - start_time)
    
    start_time = time.time()
    sum_array_index(subset_array, 0)
    sum_array_index_times.append(time.time() - start_time)
    
    
plt.scatter(x=array_sizes, y=sum_array_times, label='sum_array')
plt.scatter(x=array_sizes, y=sum_array_index_times, label='sum_array_index')
plt.ylim(
    top=max(sum_array_times + sum_array_index_times),
    bottom=min(sum_array_times + sum_array_index_times))
plt.legend()
plt.xlabel('Array Size')
plt.ylabel('Time (seconds)')
plt.plot()


'''
As you can see, the function sum_array is a polynomial and sum_array_index is linear as we predicted.

However, in our pursuit to use recursion we actually made things worse. Let's look at an iterative 
solution to this problem:
'''
def sum_array_iter(array):
    result = 0
    for x in array:
        result += x
    return f"Array iteration result is {result}"

arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(sum_array_iter(arr))

"""
The sum_array_iter function is a lot more straightforward than the two recursive functions, which is 
important. Second, to help ensure an answer that is correct and bug free, you generally want to pick 
the solution that is more readable. In some cases recursion is more readable and in some cases iteration 
is more readable. As you gain experience reading other people's code, you'll get an intuition for code 
readability.
