Permutation
Question - Let's use recursion to help us solve the following permutation problem:

Given a list of items, the goal is to find all of the permutations of that list. For example,
Given a list like: [0, 1, 2]
Permutations: [[0, 1, 2], [0, 2, 1], [1, 0, 2], [1, 2, 0], [2, 0, 1], [2, 1, 0]]

Notice that the expected output is a list of permutation with each permuted item being represented by a list. 
Such an object that contains other object is called "compound" object.

The Idea
Build a compoundList incrementally starting with a blank list, and permute (add) each element of original input 
list at all possible positions.


For example, take [0, 1, 2] as the original input list:
    1. Start with a blank compoundList [[]]. This is actually the last call of recursive function stack. Pick the 
        element 2 of original input list, making the compoundList as [[2]]
    
    2. Pick next element 1 of original input list, and add this element at position 0, and 1 for each list of 
        previous compoundList. We will require to create copy of all lists of previous compoundList, and add the new 
        element. Now, the compoundList will become [[1, 2], [2, 1]].

    3. Pick next element 0 of original input list, and add this element at position 0, 1, and 2 for each list of 
        previous compoundList. Now, the compoundList will become 
        [[0, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2], [1, 2, 0], [0, 2, 1], [2, 0, 1], [2, 1, 0]] .


Additional Resource
While dealing with a "compound" object, a simple copy operation might not work as expected. You would need a function 
that can create a deep copy. For this purpose, you can make use of deepcopy() function from the copy module in Python. 
This module provides the function for normal (Shallow) and deep copy operations. Refer here - 
https://docs.python.org/3/library/copy.html for syntax and detailed information, that says:


Difference between Deep and Shallow Copy
The difference between shallow and deep copying is only relevant for compound objects (objects that contain other 
objects, like lists or class instances):

    - A shallow copy constructs a new compound object and then inserts references into it to the objects found in 
        the original.
    - A deep copy constructs a new compound object and then, recursively, inserts copies into it of the objects found 
        in the original.
