Task 0
Time complexity is constant because the indices chosen will directly access te first and last rows

Task 1
Time complexity O(n + n) where the first n is the length of the text data and the second n is the length of the calls data. 
The set function is implemented as a hash table with a Big-O(1).
Overall the worst case big O notation is O(n).

Task 2
Time complexity is O(n). The complexity of the call_duration variable and if statement are negligible.

Task 3
Part A - Time complexity is ~10n because of all the checks being made in the code_extractor() function. 
The filtering of the list for unique values with set  and joining of the strings has a O(n) worst case notation

Part B - The second loop to get the percentage gives a time complexity of O(n^2)


Task 4
Similar to Part B of Task 3
Time complexity is O(n^2)
